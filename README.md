# Code examples used in the re:Invent 2018 session ENT-356S

This repo contains Terraform code shown in the AWS re:Invent 2018 session **ENT-356S: How Cox Automotive Runs GitHub Enterprise on AWS**, which demonstrates the use of a Terraform module to define the infrastructure for a GitHub Enterprise environment. The module creates a pair of instances meant for a High Availability configuration, with the first instance configured as a primary appliance using an exported configuration from an existing GitHub Enterprise appliance.
